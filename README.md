### Hi there! üëã

I'm Federico Capoano, a passionate full stack software developer and risk
taker, core developer of [OpenWISP](https://openwisp.org) and
[NetJSON](https://netjson.org).

I believe **the internet is humanity's greatest invention**, and I'm dedicated
to expanding its reach.

Since 2011, I focused my efforts on building open source networking tools to
bridge the digital divide and bring more people online.

No, I am not poor and I don't need you to
buy me a coffee, thank you for worrying though! üòÅ

Fortunately, since 2017, I have been able to run a small company that is dedicated
to helping businesses leverage OpenWISP, OpenWrt, and other popular open source
networking tools. That's how I fund the development and maintenance of OpenWISP,
if you were wondering.

On the side, I have also been mentoring new volunteers in Open Source through
the [Google Summer of Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPH_JwceQa8) program since 2012.

Feel free to explore my projects and contributions on GitHub, check out the repositories in
the [@openwisp](https://github.com/openwisp) organization, or get in touch with
me via the [OpenWISP Support Channels](https://openwisp.org/support.html)!
